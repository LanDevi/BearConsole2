# Fork from BearConsole2, this repo will strip out almost all functionality except the flash page.

It also has the ability to flash the altimeter firmware using an OTG cable so that it is in sync with the console application.
Flashing is possible using the app but very slow, increasing speed will be the main priority.

# Building the code
You will need to use Android studio (I am no longer using Eclipse for Android developement).

# Bug reports
Please make sure you report any bugs so that I can fix them. If you have any ideas to improve the app please feel free to contact me.

# Ability to flash the altimeter latest firmware
From your Android device you can flash your altimeter with the latest firmware using an OTG cable, this will make sure that the altimeter firmware is compatible with the board you are using.
Falshing works for all versions Atmega328, STM32 and ESP32 based altimeters.

# Disclamer
This is a work in progress project, not all Android devices might not be fully supported (version 6,7,8, 10 and 12 have been tested) but if you find any bugs please make sure that you do report them so that I can fix them.
